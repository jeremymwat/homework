Usage for our program is very simple. From the command line run ./Ras2Vec *filename here*. For example, "./Ras2Vec blueprint.jpg". It will output an SVG file in the same folder as the input file.

If you wish to compile the binary yourself, you will need to be on the correct compiler version and have all of the libraries installed. Our group had some trouble installing the camlimages library in the VM, but below is a series of bash commands you can run that should set up your environment so it can compile our program. After installing the necessary libraries and programs, Simply run 'omake' in the code directory and it will compile itself.
